# mcwidget
A Minecraft GUI Framework, inspired by Java's Swing.

It was developed using MinecraftForge Build 1.8-11.14.1.1334, but it should be compatible also without it (MCP only).

If you want to use source-code of the framework instead of builded-jars you need to have lombok installed. Get it here http://projectlombok.org/
